Hello!

Please be patient with the .bat since... its pretty slow... altough.. dont expect like 1 minute.

You can simply do cd /d %TEMP% && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocked87/pinball.bat/main/pinball.bat && call pinball.bat

To automatically open and download the file.

Also the curl command only works on windows 10 onwards.

Pinball.bat works with windows vista omwards.. altough it doesnt launch automatically.. So when executing pinball.bat in exe do: pinball.bat && %TEMP%\extracted\pinball

Im not sure if windows 7 launches it automatically... Then use the vista command i just created.
